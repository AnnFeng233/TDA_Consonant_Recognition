- The `results` folder contains ROC, and AUC for machine learning, as well birthtime, and lifetime of consonants.
- The `consonants_waveforms` folder contains waveforms of pulmonic consonants. Audio for these consonants comes from [Wiki-List of consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_consonants). This gives consonants concrete shapes for readers.
